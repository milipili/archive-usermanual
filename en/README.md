The Nany Programming Language
=============================

Nany is a statically-typed, multi-paradigm, compiled (to native code or bytecode)
programming language, and is designed for high-end, high-performance,
abd above all, high-productivity computing.




Rationale
---------

Computer science progresses steadily and so does the art of computer programming.
Steady progression in the various existing languages brings new features to well-known
and proven technologies. It seems only natural to wonder what a whole new
programming language can bring to the table in this world of constantly
improving languages.

History tells us that technological improvement follows a cycle of evolution and
revolution, in which steady progression is sometimes abruptly cut off by a major
change in the landscape. New programming languages are created all the time and
it is true that only a few manage to shake the existing practices.
However, we believe that there is room today for new ways to program, that a
time of revolution is at hand, and Nany is the embodiment of this belief.



Purpose
-------

Nany aims to be as simple and easy-to-use as possible but achieving high-level
features through key concepts, like copy-on-write, reference counting or
transactional memory.
