Class
=====

**Nany** provides an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, named class. The class has its internal structure (variable members) and external behaviour (public methods). Not only the OOP features (like inheritance) are offered, but also some unusual and neat features like **outlet** - which allows user to modify class behaviour, in order to adapt his/her needs.
